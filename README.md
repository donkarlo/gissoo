# About Gissoo Application
 * The goal of this application is generating small pieces of literary texts with maximum artistic values by taking advantage of a set of mathematically defined artistic indexes in a vector space generated by appropriate word embedddings and clustered by different strategies. In the very first stages it tries to output very short pieces of literary text, mostly close to poetic styles such as Haiku. In further iterations, both the length and the number of artistic indexes will be extended. 

# Methodology
 * This application tries to address the absence of a creative, artful text generation model by selecting dependency sequences derived from corpora such that the maximum artistic value is achieved through mathematically defining a set of artfulness indexes using stochastic gradient descent.
 # Applied artistic indexes
  * Transition between antonym semantic vector classes
  * Ambiguity appeal
  * Valence, arousal and dominance(VAD) gravity of dependency sequences
